# Fake-Email
1. Concept Definition Display Name Spoofing is a type of email impersonation attack where a threat actor modifies the "friendly" name shown to the recipient while using a legitimate, unrelated email address. It exploits the User Interface (UI) design of modern email clients rather than a technical flaw in the email protocol.
